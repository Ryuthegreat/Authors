<h2> <align="center">  <font color="2E4374"> <u>   ‎♡₊˚ MY SCHOOL・₊✧  </u> </font>  </h2>
<p style=font-family:"Verdana"> <font color="black"> - I am currently a <u> Grade 10 </u> student at <b>Notre Dame of Tacurong College </b> from <i> St.Martin </i>. My favorite subjects are <u>Science</u>,<u> Mapeh</u>, and <u>TLE</u>, while my weakness in studying is about numbers, patterns, and so on, in short Math. Being a student entails obligations and discipline. I am responsible for assisting my co-officer in managing the class, especially when there are activities, and I am responsible for studying properly. Being disciplined in terms of managing time and completing tasks on schedule. My life as a high school student is challenging; I face several obstacles, issues, and so on, but I will do my best to enjoy and spend time with my teachers and classmates. I will make certain that my final high school year is memorable.

<h2> <align="center"> <font color="2E4374"> <u>  .⋆｡⋆˚｡⋆｡˚｡⋆.  MY FRIENDS      .⋆｡⋆˚｡⋆｡˚｡⋆.  </u> </h2>
<p style=font-family:"Verdana"> <font color="black">  - In our lives, having a friend is the most common that comes in our life. Having them is the most I am grateful for because  they are always there when I have problems. They are healing the inner me, making me laugh even when it is difficult, and are willing to combat the difficulties with me. My friends are regular people, yet they are all significant to me because they teach me how to love genuinely. My first bestfriend is <b> Alexandria Monique Tuvera</b> from <i>pre-school</i> to now, we have been bestfriends for <u> 11 years </u>, I am very delighted to have her because she knows me so well that other people don't, I feel so comfortable when I'm with her. My dearest friends at my present school are <b> Jean Sangki (Jeaners) </b>, <b>Sofia Cusi (Tsup)</b>, and <b>Deanna Tino (Deng) </b>. They made me joyful and taught me to "never give up, always fight." As a vulnerable person, I learnt to fight.

<h2> <align="center"> <font color="2E4374"> <u>    ˙✧˖°MY HOBBIES/SPORTS ༘ ⋆｡˚  </u> </h3>
<p style=font-family:"Verdana"> <font color="black"> - My hobbies/sports are <b> dancing</b>, <b> lawn tennis </b>, and <b>eating</b>, and they have made me feel more active. I learnt a lot from discovering my skills, such as dancing. When I was in kindergarten, I used to dance on stage, but my first goal was my academics, so I didn't continue to dance. But now I'm moving out of my comfort zone because I'm wondering, "Why am I here doing nothing?", "Am I really going to stay in my comfort zone and avoid doing the things I genuinely want?". My second hobby is playing lawn tennis. I enjoy playing and learning lawn tennis because it is the only time I reward myself as self-care. I enjoy eating, especially if the food is delicious. A fun fact about me is that I get very angry when I am hungry, which is why my father always refers to me as "hangry girl." <i> Food is life, but having a full stomach is lifer; life is brief, so enjoy it and eat anything you want.</i>

<h2> <align="center"> <font color="2E4374"> <u> ˙⊹ ੈ✰MY REALIZATION/INSIGHTS ABOUT COVID-19 PANDEMIC✰ ੈ⊹˙ </u> </h3>
<p style=font-family:"Verdana"> <font color="black"> - I experienced <b> anxiety </b> throughout this pandemic since there was no one to talk to, I was unable to leave the house, I lost my confidence. It's challenging to have severe anxiety because there are times when I can't breathe. When this happens, I run to the hospital and check my ECG. The doctor advises that the wave is not normal and that I should get an echocardiogram. The next day, my parents didn't think twice about bringing me to the vital clinic. The result was normal, and the doctor informed us that I have severe anxiety and have been taking medication. Because it happened so quickly, that storyline was the biggest I've ever seen. I learned how to love God and I got closer to God because, he heals everything about me. In that situation, I offer my life and problems to him. Not all of them are the saddest, but there is one that I will never forget. On my birthday, I believed that it wouldn't be a good one because my father wouldn't be there, and of course, there were many other things on my mind. However, my cousins made me smile by making me laugh and by wishing me a good day over the phone. Because of the pandemic, I now value more what people do, even if they only do small things. This made me extremely happy.
