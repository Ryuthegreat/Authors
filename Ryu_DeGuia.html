I am Ryu Dane Mickel P. De Guia, a boy who was born in BRGY. Buenaflor PRK. STO. Nino on a Saturday on June 7th, 2008, as an only child. I am not one of those people who knows how to tell other people about their lives, but I will try my best to do so. My father's name is Ardee John De Guia, and my mother's name is Michelle M. Palmes. I am an only child, but I have two half brothers, and their names are Aegon and Aedan.

The short story is that I study at school. I graduated from kindergarten at Notre Dame of Siena, and sadly, I didn't get to experience graduating from elementary school because of the whole pandemic situation. I am currently studying at NDTC (Notre Dame of Tacurong College) in hopes of graduating here from high school. I haven't yet decided which school I should study at for senior high school, but I hope that during the next summer I will be able to decide which school I should choose.

I am a simple boy living in a simple world who has a big dream. I always try to make big achievements, but I still haven't. My low self-esteem tends to try to destroy my spirit. One of my weaknesses is that I am not confident at the very least, I am considerably shy, and it takes a lot of time for me to be able to become friends with other people since I am not that good at socializing.

<br><br>

My hobby is playing video games. Surprise! expected, am I right? But I seriously love playing video games, and yes, I do take care of myself, ensuring that I won't overdo it, and I always try to maintain good grades while also being good at playing video games. I met a lot of people by playing video games, and I still talk to them uptil now. I also play video games with my classmates, which is really fun you should try it as well! It's really great to be able to play with them, have fun, and make meaningful and everlasting memories with them.

One thing I figured out during all my years of studying in school is that we should not overdo it and try our very best. I may not be good at life advice, but I can say that we should always take care of ourselves and do what our bodies can. We should always take a rest every now and then and just enjoy life to the fullest, as the quote says "Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey".
